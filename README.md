# SpotLot
Spot Lot is a phone application project done in a group project of 6 people under agile methodology with a main focus in parking resources for consumers and management of the app.
My job within the project was to create the navigation and graphical user interface of the application using C# in visual studio with xamarin to make the app for both android and iOS.
Have PDF of SRS documentation, will upload in the future.
